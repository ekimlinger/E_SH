#Shell Scripts

This repository is to store all of my current shell scripts to make programming life easier. Instead of manually starting up a server or having to copy a different project folder, I've decided to write my own scripts to do it for me. Depending on the type of stack you want (currently only SEAN and MEAN stacks), it will install all the basic dependancies, directory structures, and files you need to start a server from scratch.

##Installation

Download or clone repository. Add all functions into your .bash_profile (under your home directory). Restart your terminal and simply run "installSeanStack" or "installMeanStack", and "installNodeFolders" where you would like the server installed.

##Contribute
I'm definitely not the first one to do this, so if you have any suggestions or bug fixes be sure submit a pull request or let me know!
